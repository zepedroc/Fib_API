# Fibonacci_API

API running on https://wondrous-dango-ab8623.netlify.app

API hosted on Netlify because of its free services and good recomendations online.

## Requests

Two endpoints:

- /fibSeqNum/:position - Fetch the n'th number of the Fibonacci Sequence

- /requests - Fetch all the previous requests

Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to allow cross origin requests.

## Persist Requests Data

Considered using MongoDB for storing the requests data but at the same time thought I was over-doing it.
